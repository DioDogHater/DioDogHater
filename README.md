# Who are you bro?
I'm just a teenager with a lot of experience. I'm trying to do cool stuff mostly in C since it's my favorite language. I made multiple projects, but some of them aren't good.

# What do you do?
Well like I said before, I do mostly C, but sometimes I try website dev, but I'm not good at it. I also code in various languages such as C, C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I hate Rust btw. It just pisses me off.

# What are my interests
Video games, making them and their engines, 3D graphics, 3D engines, etc. I also enjoy dilly-dallying in networking once in a while (check out my library) and some cool stuff like ASCII art rendering and other shenanigans.
